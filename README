This is a CSE220 Research Project for the Verilog Parser Slang

Slang and how to build it can be done here: https://github.com/MikePopoloski/slang

The specific tool I used to do my testing is on Rewritter.cpp found in the /slang/tools/rewriter directory.

After making the build the executable is located in the build/bin folder 

FullAdder.v is the input verilog file I feed into the rewritter.

Usage: ./Rewritter <input verilog file>
